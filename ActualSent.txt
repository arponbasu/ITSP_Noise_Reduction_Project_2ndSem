1276    eng Let's try something.
1277	eng	I have to go to sleep.
1280	eng	Today is June 18th and it is Muiriel's birthday!
1282	eng	Muiriel is 20 now.
1283	eng	The password is "Muiriel".
1284	eng	I will be back soon.
1286	eng	I'm at a loss for words.
1287	eng	This is never going to end.
1288	eng	I just don't know what to say.
1289	eng	That was an evil bunny.
1290	eng	I was in the mountains.
1291	eng	Is it a recent picture?
1292	eng	I don't know if I have the time.
1294	eng	Education in this world disappoints me.
1295	eng	You're in better shape than I am.
1296	eng	You are in my way.
1298	eng	This will cost €30.
1299	eng	I make €100 a day.
1300	eng	I may give up soon and just nap instead.
1301	eng	It's because you don't want to be alone.
1302	eng	That won't happen.
1303	eng	Sometimes he can be a strange guy.
1304	eng	I'll do my best not to disturb your studying.
1305	eng	I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
1306	eng	I suppose it's different when you think about it over the long term.
1308	eng	I miss you.
1309	eng	I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
1310	eng	I always liked mysterious characters more.
1311	eng	You should sleep.
1312	eng	I'm going to go.
1313	eng	I told them to send me another ticket.
1314	eng	You're so impatient with me.
1315	eng	I can't live that kind of life.
1316	eng	I once wanted to be an astrophysicist.
1317	eng	I never liked biology.
1318	eng	The last person I told my idea to thought I was nuts.
1319	eng	If the world weren't in the shape it is now, I could trust anyone.
1320	eng	It is unfortunately true.
1321	eng	They are too busy fighting against each other to care for common ideals.
1322	eng	Most people think I'm crazy.
1323	eng	No I'm not; you are!
1324	eng	That's MY line!
1325	eng	He's kicking me!
1326	eng	Are you sure?
1327	eng	Then there is a problem...
1328	eng	Oh, there's a butterfly!
1329	eng	Hurry up.
1330	eng	It doesn't surprise me.
1332	eng	For some reason I feel more alive at night.
1333	eng	It depends on the context.
1334	eng	Are you freaking kidding me?!
1335	eng	That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
1336	eng	I don't want to be lame; I want to be cool!!
1337	eng	When I grow up, I want to be a king.
1338	eng	America is a lovely place to be, if you are here to earn money.
1339	eng	I'm so fat.
1340	eng	So what?
1341	eng	I'm gonna shoot him.
1342	eng	I'm not a real fish, I'm just a mere plushy.
1343	eng	I'm just saying!
1344	eng	That was probably what influenced their decision.
1345	eng	I've always wondered what it'd be like to have siblings.
1346	eng	This is what I would have said.
1347	eng	It would take forever for me to explain everything.
1348	eng	That's because you're a girl.
1349	eng	Sometimes I can't help showing emotions.
1350	eng	It's a word I'd like to find a substitute for.
1351	eng	It would be something I'd have to program.
1352	eng	I don't intend to be selfish.
1353	eng	Let's consider the worst that could happen.
1354	eng	How many close friends do you have?
1355	eng	I may be antisocial, but it doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
1356	eng	This is always the way it has been.
1357	eng	I think it is best not to be impolite.
1358	eng	One can always find time.
1359	eng	I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.
1360	eng	Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning.
1361	eng	When I woke up, I was sad.
1362	eng	That is somewhat explained at the end.
1363	eng	I thought you liked to learn new things.
1364	eng	Most people write about their daily life.
1365	eng	If I could send you a marshmallow, Trang, I would.
1366	eng	In order to do that, you have to take risks.
1367	eng	Every person who is alone is alone because they are afraid of others.
1368	eng	Why do you ask?
1369	eng	I am not an artist. I never had the knack for it.
1370	eng	I can't tell her now. It's not that simple anymore.
1371	eng	I am a flawed person, but these are flaws that can easily be fixed.
1372	eng	Whenever I find something I like, it's too expensive.
1373	eng	How long did you stay?
1374	eng	Maybe it will be exactly the same for him.
1375	eng	Innocence is a beautiful thing.
1376	eng	Humans were never meant to live forever.
1377	eng	I don't want to lose my ideas, even though some of them are a bit extreme.
1378	eng	I think I have a theory about that.
1379	eng	That is intriguing.
1380	eng	You are saying you intentionally hide your good looks?
1381	eng	I do not have an account in these forums.
1382	eng	If anyone was to ask what the point of the story is, I really don't know.
1383	eng	I didn't know where it came from.
1384	eng	I think my living with you has influenced your way of living.
1385	eng	This is not important.
1386	eng	I didn't like it.
1387	eng	She's asking how that's possible.
1388	eng	You're just running away from life's problems.
1389	eng	If you look at the lyrics, they don't really mean much.
1390	eng	There's a problem there that you don't see.
1391	eng	You can do it.
1392	eng	My physics teacher doesn't care if I skip classes.
1393	eng	I wish I could go to Japan.
1394	eng	I hate it when there are a lot of people.
1395	eng	I have to go to bed.
1396	eng	After that, I left, but then I realized that I forgot my backpack at their house.
1397	eng	I won't ask you anything else today.
1398	eng	It may freeze next week.
1399	eng	Even though he apologized, I'm still furious.
1400	eng	The police will get you to find the bullets.
1401	eng	Thanks for having explained to me at last why people take me for an idiot.
1402	eng	That wasn't my intention.
1403	eng	Thanks for your explanation.
1404	eng	Theoretically, I'm doing math.
1406	eng	If you didn't know me that way then you simply didn't know me.
1407	eng	It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
1408	eng	I don't know what you mean.
1409	eng	My computer has got to be useful for something.
1410	eng	You wanted to tell me about freedom?
1411	eng	Uh, now it's really weird...
1412	eng	If I wanted to scare you, I would tell you what I dreamt about a few weeks ago.
1413	eng	One can't expect everything from schools.
1414	eng	There are many words that I don't understand.
1415	eng	I don't like it when mathematicians who know much more than I do can't express themselves explicitly.
1416	eng	You're really not stupid.
1417	eng	I need to ask you a silly question.
1418	eng	I don't know how to demonstrate it, since it's too obvious!
1419	eng	I wouldn't have thought I would someday look up "Viagra" in Wikipedia.
1420	eng	Can it be phrased in another way?
1421	eng	No one will know.
1422	eng	I found a solution, but I found it so fast that it can't be the right solution.
1423	eng	It seems interesting to me.
1424	eng	Except that here, it's not so simple.
1425	eng	I like candlelight.
1426	eng	What did you answer?
1427	eng	No, he's not my new boyfriend.
1428	eng	It's too bad that I don't need to lose weight.
1429	eng	You never have class or what?!
1430	eng	I will play Sudoku then instead of continuing to bother you.
1431	eng	Where is the problem?
1432	eng	I can only wait.
1433	eng	It's not much of a surprise, is it?
1434	eng	I love you.
1435	eng	I don't like you anymore.
1436	eng	I am curious.
1437	eng	Congratulations!
1438	eng	I don't want to wait that long.
1439	eng	Why don't you come visit us?
1440	eng	But the possibility seems unlikely.
1442	eng	I shouldn't have logged off.
1443	eng	I don't know what to do anymore.
1444	eng	It is inevitable that I go to France someday, I just don't know when.
1445	eng	I hate chemistry.
1446	eng	I didn't want this to happen.
1447	eng	You can probably guess what happens though.
1448	eng	Next thing you know, you'll be in the papers.
1449	eng	What other options do I have?
1450	eng	I am not much of a traveller.
1451	eng	I have nothing better to do.
1452	eng	I can't explain it either.
1453	eng	Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.
1454	eng	Seriously though, episode 21 made me almost cry while laughing.
1455	eng	It only shows you're not a robot.
1456	eng	How could I be a robot? Robots don't dream.
1458	eng	It's not something anyone can do.
1459	eng	I don't know if I still have it.
1460	eng	What do you think I've been doing?
1461	eng	Don't underestimate my power.
1462	eng	My mom doesn't speak English very well.
1463	eng	I don't speak French well enough!
1464	eng	I was wondering if you were going to show up today.
1465	eng	Therein lies the problem.
1466	eng	How do you find food in outer space?
1467	eng	All you can do is trust one another.
1468	eng	Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous!
1469	eng	Why are you sorry for something you haven't done?
1470	eng	I utterly despise formal writing!
1471	eng	Foreign people intrigue me.
1472	eng	Whatever I do, she says I can do better.
1473	eng	What keeps you up so late?
1474	eng	You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
1475	eng	I don't have anyone who'd travel with me.
1476	eng	You're not fast enough.
1477	eng	Life is hard, but I am harder.
1478	eng	Bearing can be unbearable.
1479	eng	Stop it! You're making her feel uncomfortable!
1480	eng	Nothing is beautiful but the truth.
1481	eng	Tomorrow, he will land on the moon.
1482	eng	I don't speak Japanese.
1483	eng	This is a pun.
1484	eng	Nobody understands me.
1485	eng	I learned to live without her.
1486	eng	It's useless to keep on thinking any more.
1487	eng	I have too many things on my mind these days.
1488	eng	I just wanted to check my email.
1489	eng	Do you really need to ask the question to know the answer?
1490	eng	You can't expect me to always think of everything!
1491	eng	I suppose that behind each thing we have to do, there's something we want to do...
1492	eng	You really don't have the right priorities!
1493	eng	Don't expect others to think for you!
1494	eng	You never have time for important things!
1495	eng	It's no use pretending to make me believe that I believe things you don't believe!
1496	eng	It would take me too much time to explain to you why it's not going to work.
1497	eng	I'm so dumb... I'm trying to explain things to you that I don't understand myself.
1498	eng	Stop seeing me as a "normal" person!
1499	eng	Are you referring to me?
1500	eng	There will always be things I will never learn, I don't have eternity before me!
1501	eng	It can't be!
1502	eng	I wish I could care more about my grades but it seems that, at a certain point of my life, I decided they wouldn't be so important anymore.
1503	eng	"A rolling stone gathers no moss" is a proverb.
1504	eng	Would you like something to drink?
1505	eng	"Who is it?" "It's your mother."
1506	eng	"When will you be back?" "It all depends on the weather."
1507	eng	"What's the matter?" asked the little white rabbit.
1508	eng	"What's going on in the cave? I'm curious." "I have no idea."
1509	eng	We must learn to live together as brothers, or we will perish together as fools.
1510	eng	Uh... How's that working?
1511	eng	"To tell you the truth, I am scared of heights." "You are a coward!"
1512	eng	"Trust me," he said.
1513	eng	"This is what I was looking for!" he exclaimed.
1514	eng	"This looks pretty interesting," Hiroshi says.
1515	eng	Their communication may be much more complex than we thought.
1516	eng	"The phone is ringing." "I'll get it."
1517	eng	"That's very nice of you," Willie answered.
1518	eng	"Thank you for helping me." "Don't mention it."
1519	eng	Someday I'll run like the wind.
1520	eng	"She likes music." "So do I."
1521	eng	Please don't cry.
1522	eng	Let me know if there is anything I can do.
1523	eng	It may be that the happiness awaiting us is not at all the sort of happiness we would want.
1524	eng	It is up to you to decide whether we will go there or not.
1525	eng	Class doesn't begin until eight-thirty.
1526	eng	I want a boat that will take me far away from here.
1527	eng	"I feel like playing cards." "So do I."
1528	eng	"Haven't we met somewhere before?" asked the student.
1529	eng	A Japanese would never do such a thing.
1530	eng	Allen is a poet.
1531	eng	The archer killed the deer.
1532	eng	Communism will never be reached in my lifetime.
1533	eng	Rye was called the grain of poverty.
1534	eng	In the 1950's, the Finns were cited as having one of the least healthy diets in the world.
1535	eng	If you see a mistake, then please correct it.
1536	eng	Place the deck of cards on the oaken table.
1537	eng	The Germans are very crafty.
1538	eng	If you don't eat, you die.
1539	eng	How do you spell "pretty"?
1540	eng	Why don't we go home?
1541	eng	I'm sorry, I can't stay long.
1542	eng	Ten years is a long time to wait.
1543	eng	"Why aren't you going?" "Because I don't want to."
1544	eng	One million people lost their lives in the war.
1547	eng	It is not rare at all to live over ninety years.
1549	eng	First, I'm going to do an outline of my new website.
1550	eng	Democracy is the worst form of government, except all the others that have been tried.
1551	eng	When you're beginning to look like the photo in your passport, you should go on a holiday.
1552	eng	It wasn't me, commissioner!
1553	eng	Oh, my white pants! And they were new.
1554	eng	With so many people around he naturally became a bit nervous.
1555	eng	When I left the train station, I saw a man.
1557	eng	You're an angel!
1558	eng	People from Madrid are weird.
1559	eng	Well, the night is quite long, isn't it?
1560	eng	You're lucky because he didn't bite you.
1561	eng	Did you miss me?
1563	eng	Are they all the same?
1564	eng	Thank you very much!
1565	eng	Where are the eggs, please?
1566	eng	I'll take him.
1567	eng	It's a surprise.
1568	eng	That's a good idea!
1569	eng	Round trip? Only one-way.
1570	eng	It's a pity when somebody dies.
1571	eng	They were left speechless.
1572	eng	Damn! It's not bad!
1573	eng	Pull into shape after washing.
1574	eng	Wash before first wearing.
1575	eng	Don't open before the train stops.
1577	eng	Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
1578	eng	They say love is blind.
1579	eng	Oh, I'm sorry.
1580	eng	Math is like love: a simple idea, but it can get complicated.
1581	eng	The only useful answers are those that raise new questions.
1582	eng	To have doubts about oneself is the first sign of intelligence.
1583	eng	Poor is not the one who has too little, but the one who wants too much.
1584	eng	Seeing that you're not surprised, I think you must have known.
1585	eng	How long does it take to get to the station?
1586	eng	This will be a good souvenir of my trip around the United States.
1587	eng	Excuse me; allow me to point out three errors in the above article.
1589	eng	It is difficult to keep up a conversation with someone who only says "yes" and "no".
1590	eng	Do you speak Italian?
1591	eng	"I can't think with that noise," she said, as she stared at the typewriter.
1592	eng	It is said that "Hamlet" is the most interesting play ever written.
1594	eng	May I ask a question?
1595	eng	"How do you feel?" he inquired.
1596	eng	It's quite difficult to master French in 2 or 3 years.
1597	eng	It's impossible for me to explain it to you.
1598	eng	I don't want to spend the rest of my life regretting it.
1599	eng	It would be fun to see how things change over the years.
1600	eng	I would never have guessed that.
1601	eng	Imagination affects every aspect of our lives.
1602	eng	You'll forget about me someday.
1603	eng	That is rather unexpected.
1604	eng	I wonder how long it's going to take.
1605	eng	I can't live without a TV.
1606	eng	I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
1607	eng	Nothing is achieved without effort.
1608	eng	Many people drift through life without a purpose.
1609	eng	Life without love is just totally pointless.
1610	eng	Let me know if I need to make any changes.
1611	eng	I think exams are ruining education.
1612	eng	We can't sleep because of the noise.
1613	eng	Do you have a condom?
1615	eng	Do whatever he tells you.
1616	eng	I can walk to school in 10 minutes.
1617	eng	It took me more than two hours to translate a few pages of English.
1618	eng	It is already eleven.
1619	eng	May I talk to Ms. Brown?
1620	eng	"Yes, orange juice please," says Mike.
1621	eng	"Ah!" is an interjection.
1622	eng	What do you want?
1623	eng	The mandatory character of schooling is rarely analyzed in the multitude of works dedicated to the study of the various ways to develop within children the desire to learn.
1624	eng	You suck dude! I have to tell you everything!
1625	eng	I have a bone to pick with you.
1626	eng	Do you need me to give you some money?
1627	eng	Paris is the most beautiful city in the world.
1629	eng	Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
1630	eng	I have a dream.
1631	eng	This is my friend Rachel. We went to high school together.
1632	eng	The cost of life increased drastically.
1633	eng	All that which is invented, is true.
1634	eng	To be surprised, to wonder, is to begin to understand.
1635	eng	But the universe is infinite.
1636	eng	To be perfect she lacked just one defect.
1637	eng	And yet, the contrary is always true as well.
1638	eng	We don't see things as they are, but as we are.
1639	eng	The world is a den of crazies.
1640	eng	You opened up my eyes to what it's like when everything is right.
1641	eng	You found me where no one else was looking.
1642	eng	You're by my side; everything's fine now.
1643	eng	What do you mean you don't know?!
1644	eng	You look stupid.
1645	eng	I think I'm gonna go to sleep.
1646	eng	My name is Jack.
1647	eng	I like it very much.
1648	eng	We're meeting up tomorrow?
1649	eng	How do you say that in Italian?
1650	eng	I have to go shopping. I'll be back in an hour.
1651	eng	Is it far from here?
1652	eng	These things aren't mine!
1653	eng	Thanks, that's all.
1654	eng	Would you like to dance with me?
1658	eng	Italy is a very beautiful country.
1659	eng	It's not my fault!
1660	eng	I'd like to stay for one night.
1661	eng	Could you dial for me? The telephone is too high.
1662	eng	Is there a youth hostel near here?
1663	eng	Where are the showers?
1664	eng	Open your mouth!
1665	eng	Is it bad?
1666	eng	I have lost my wallet.
1668	eng	Love is never wasted.
1669	eng	Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.
1670	eng	Not wanting is the same as having.
1671	eng	He's very sexy.
1673	eng	"Pass me the salt, please." "Here you are."
1674	eng	There are too many things to do!
1676	eng	Come on, play with me, I'm so bored!
1677	eng	Don't you even think of eating my chocolate!
1678	eng	Stop asking me for a drink! Go get it yourself.
1679	eng	Thanks to you I've lost my appetite.
1680	eng	I really need to hit somebody.
1681	eng	Who doesn't know this problem?!
1682	eng	It has been so long since I last went to Disneyland with my family.
1683	eng	My parents keep arguing about stupid things. It's so annoying!
1684	eng	If you don't want to put on sunscreen, that's your problem. Just don't come complaining to me when you get a sunburn.
1685	eng	My friends always say I'm too calm, but my family always says I'm too annoying.
1686	eng	I hate those spiders. They're always there to freak me out when I'm cleaning.
1687	eng	So annoying... Now I get a headache whenever I use the computer!
1688	eng	It's so hot that you could cook an egg on the hood of a car.
1689	eng	It is very hot today.
1690	eng	Nobody came.
1691	eng	I never saw a red fridge.
1693	eng	Better to be hated for who you are than loved for who you're not.
1694	eng	It's lonely in the saddle since the horse died.
1695	eng	Mathematics is the part of science you could continue to do if you woke up tomorrow and discovered the universe was gone.
1696	eng	My eyes are an ocean in which my dreams are reflected.
1697	eng	You know the phrase, we reap what we sow. I have sown the wind and this is my storm.
1698	eng	Look at me when I talk to you!
1699	eng	What would the world be without women?
1700	eng	What if you gave a speech and nobody came?
1701	eng	I don't know what to say to make you feel better.
1702	eng	This is not my type.
1703	eng	I was trying to kill time.
1704	eng	How did you come up with this crazy idea?
1705	eng	I'm tired.

2137	eng	If you lend someone $20 and never see that person again, it was probably worth it.
2138	eng	The essence of liberty is mathematics.
2139	eng	His story was too ridiculous for anyone to believe.
2140	eng	How many hours of sleep do you need?
2141	eng	Each person is a world.
2142	eng	I have French nationality but Vietnamese origins.
2143	eng	It's very frustrating to try to find your glasses when you can't see anything without glasses.
2144	eng	Do you think mankind will someday colonize the Moon?
2145	eng	What famous songs do you wish you had composed, and why?
2146	eng	I'm going to buy myself a new camera, digital this time.
2147	eng	I'm crazy about you.
2148	eng	I don't know what is worse.
2149	eng	Life in prison is worse than the life of an animal.
2150	eng	I am proud to be a part of this project.
2151	eng	Beauty lies in the eyes of the one who sees.
2152	eng	Who buys this type of art?

2160	eng	I created a shortcut on the desktop.
2161	eng	I want an MP3 player!
2162	eng	My brother is very important. At least he thinks he is.
2163	eng	While eating a pizza he was annoying his sister.
2164	eng	At this rate, we're not likely to be done before the end of the week.
2165	eng	I guess my view on friendship is pretty bleak because I've never really had to rely on anyone for anything.

2167	eng	No, I cannot let you in, there's one person too many.
2168	eng	Where are you?

2383	eng	Why aren't you coming with us?
2384	eng	I can't say the opposite.
2385	eng	Why are you telling me about hippos all of the sudden? I don't see the connection between that and your twelve red goldfishes.

2463	eng	Who said that? It's totally wrong!
2464	eng	When I was a child, I would spend hours reading alone in my room.
2465	eng	Wolves won't usually attack people.
2466	eng	"Can somebody help me?" "I will."

6133	eng	I can't believe my eyes.
6135	eng	I couldn't say when exactly in my life it occurred to me that I would be a pilot someday.
6136	eng	An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
6138	eng	She has always done her best to make their life easier.
6140	eng	I've got mosquito bites all over my arm.

12621	eng	Just a minute.
13034	eng	You asked after her? What did she say?

15835	eng	You need only ask him to pay the debt.
15836	eng	You told him that he should have a reward.
15837	eng	I don't think you can gain his ear.
15838	eng	You ought to thank him.
15839	eng	You have only to give him a little help.

17425	eng	Your idea cannot be brand new. I heard about it from another source last year.
17426	eng	Your idea is definitely worth thinking about.
17427	eng	I will dry your T-shirt.
17428	eng	Your T-shirt will dry soon.
17429	eng	I regret that I told you.
17430	eng	I have something to tell you.
17431	eng	I was almost afraid to talk to you.
17432	eng	I have some good news for you.
17433	eng	I will find you a good doctor.
17434	eng	I want you to go to the post office.
17435	eng	You can count on the $3,000 I have promised you.
17436	eng	I'll make you a model plane.
17437	eng	I will forgive him out of consideration.
17438	eng	I will forgive him out of consideration for you.
17439	eng	There's a phone call for you from Akemi.
17440	eng	I want you to read this book.
17441	eng	Didn't I lend you some books? I'm sure I did.
17442	eng	You took the words right out of my mouth.
17443	eng	What you need is, in a word, patience.
17444	eng	All you need is to get a driver's license.
17445	eng	I will tell you a secret.
17446	eng	I have a message for you from her.
17447	eng	You can't have understood what he said.
17448	eng	I feel for you.
17449	eng	I cannot help you, not but that I pity you.
17450	eng	I'll boil you the beans.
17451	eng	I refuse to be treated like a slave by you.
17452	eng	Your telegram arrived just as I was about to telephone you.
17453	eng	You are wanted on the phone.
17454	eng	I couldn't call you; the telephone was out of order.
17455	eng	I must offer you an apology for coming late.
17456	eng	I'll lend it to you.
17457	eng	I look around but it's you I can't replace.
17458	eng	You shall have a nice present.
17459	eng	Do you know good from evil?
17460	eng	We'll give you your revenge.
17461	eng	Dozens of letters are awaiting you.
17462	eng	I'll make you a new suit.
17463	eng	Let me give you a bit of advice.
17464	eng	I will never forget seeing you.
17465	eng	I ordered you to get out.
17466	eng	I was going to write to you, but I was too busy.
17467	eng	Who is that girl waving to you?
17468	eng	I'll teach you how to drive a car.
17469	eng	I would like you to go instead of me.
17470	eng	I'll lend you my notebook.
17471	eng	I'm adamant that you should go.
17472	eng	I can only say that I agree with you.
17473	eng	I want you to go.
17474	eng	I have been reflecting on what you said to me.
17475	eng	I wanted to show it to you.
17476	eng	I am counting on you to deliver the opening address.
17478	eng	I waited outside on the chance of seeing you.
17479	eng	I'm very glad to see you.
17481	eng	I am looking forward to seeing you.
17482	eng	It's always delightful to see you.
17483	eng	To see you is always a great pleasure.
17485	eng	I was chagrined at missing you.
17486	eng	How I've missed you!
17487	eng	I'll tell you how to swim.
17488	eng	I would like you to come with me.
17490	eng	There is a piece of good news for you.
17491	eng	You are in part responsible for it.
17492	eng	You ought to have seen it.
17493	eng	I want you to work harder.
17494	eng	I want to see you again.
17495	eng	I'm leaving it to you.
17496	eng	You have a bright future.
17497	eng	He couldn't be good for you.
17498	eng	You have no cause for anger.
17500	eng	You've got nothing to complain of.
17501	eng	You shall want for nothing.
17502	eng	I feel indebted to you for your help during my illness.
17503	eng	You have knowledge and experience as well.
17504	eng	What seems simple to you seems complex to me.
17505	eng	I take my hat off to you.
17506	eng	I want you to be the next Soseki.
17507	eng	You have as much right as everyone else.
17508	eng	You have a tendency to talk too fast.
17509	eng	Life lies in front of you.
17510	eng	Don't you have a sense of justice?
17512	eng	You have many caring friends.
17513	eng	You are very trying to me sometimes.
17514	eng	I expect you to be punctual.
17515	eng	You got me!
17516	eng	Can't you understand the pain of your parents?
17518	eng	There is nothing wrong with you.
17519	eng	You have a gift for music.
17520	eng	I can't lie to you.
17521	eng	I can't hide the fact from you.
17522	eng	You make me feel so guilty.
17523	eng	I've given up on you!
17524	eng	You have the advantage of a good education.
17525	eng	I expect you to work harder.
17526	eng	There are few high-ranking positions left open for you.
17527	eng	You are entitled to try once again.
17528	eng	You are hopeless.
17529	eng	You have a good friend in me.
17530	eng	I bear no grudge against you.
17531	eng	I'm afraid this job is too much for you.
17532	eng	I expect you know all about it.
17533	eng	You have no business doing it.
17534	eng	You deserve the prize.
17535	eng	You have no right to say so.
17536	eng	I take my hat off to you!
17537	eng	I blush for you.
17538	eng	Green suits you.
17539	eng	I am disgusted with you.
17540	eng	I can't thank you enough.
17542	eng	You seem to be insensible of their good intentions.
17543	eng	You have no right to oppose our plan.
17544	eng	All you can do is to wait.
17545	eng	I can't keep up with you.
17546	eng	I'd like to talk with you in private.
17547	eng	I have a very sore arm where you hit me.
17548	eng	How can you say that?
17549	eng	You should have seen it.
17551	eng	I'll stand behind you if you are going to do it.
17552	eng	I guess that you can't do it.
17553	eng	We want you to sing the song.
17554	eng	I hope you have brains enough to see the difference.
17555	eng	Didn't I tell you so?
17556	eng	When you put it so strongly, I can't say I don't agree.
17557	eng	I'm anxious to see you.
17558	eng	You shall have a reward.
17560	eng	I'll give you this pendant.
17561	eng	I'll give you this camera.
17562	eng	I'll give you this money.
17563	eng	Never did I dream of meeting you here.
17564	eng	It is quite a surprise to see you here.
17565	eng	I little dreamed of seeing you here.
17566	eng	You play the guitar quite like a professional, don't you?
17567	eng	Let me give you some advice.
17568	eng	I'll treat you.
17569	eng	I have a nice present to give you.
17570	eng	Can you do that?
17571	eng	I never see you but I think of my brother.
17572	eng	I owe you ten dollars.
17573	eng	A thousand yen is owed to you.
17574	eng	You should not play a joke on me.
17575	eng	Do your work in your own way.
17576	eng	I thought you'd be the last person to do such a thing.
17577	eng	If I were you, I'd be able to succeed.
17578	eng	You can make it! Go for it. I'll stand by you.
17579	eng	You deserve to succeed.
17580	eng	You could get into the Guinness Book of World Records as the heaviest drinker.
17581	eng	I can't think of life without you.
17583	eng	It's not the time but the will that you lack.
17584	eng	I have no more time to talk with you.
17588	eng	You and I are good friends.
17589	eng	You and I are the same age.
17592	eng	Beside you, I'm only a beginner at this game.
17593	eng	What's your relation with him?
17594	eng	I am not to blame any more than you are.
17595	eng	He, just like you, is a good golfer.
17596	eng	I as well as you am to blame.
17597	eng	I am not excited any more than you are.
17598	eng	I as well as you was late for school yesterday.
17599	eng	I share your idea.
17600	eng	I bought the same shirt as yours.
17601	eng	He is no more a fool than you are.
17602	eng	If only I could speak English as fluently as you!
17603	eng	You and I are very good friends.
17604	eng	There is a fundamental difference between your opinion and mine.
17605	eng	Either you or I have to go there.
17606	eng	It is hard to distinguish you from your brother.
17607	eng	I feel relaxed with you.
17608	eng	I'll take my chances with you.
17609	eng	I'd love to go with you to the show, but I'm flat broke.
17610	eng	I'd like to go with you, but as it is I can't.
17611	eng	I'd like to go to the seaside with you.
17612	eng	I wish I could go to the party with you.
17613	eng	It is a great pleasure being with you.
17614	eng	I beg to differ, as I disagree with your analysis of the situation.
17615	eng	It pains me to disagree with your opinion.
17616	eng	Listen, um, I was wondering, what are you and Molly doing tonight?
17617	eng	You and I are good friends, but we have little in common.
17618	eng	I'm leaving you tomorrow.
17619	eng	I often think about the place where I met you.
17620	eng	I would like to go to the concert with you.
17621	eng	He'll be sure to smell a rat if I'm with you.
17622	eng	I would prefer to speak to you in private.
17623	eng	You really are hopeless.
17624	eng	You two are the nucleus of the team.
17625	eng	I'll get something to drink for both of you.
17626	eng	I don't like both of you going to such a place.
17627	eng	There is enough bread for all of you.
17628	eng	Divide the cake among you three.
17629	eng	You students are supposed to be diligent.
17630	eng	How old will you be next year?
17631	eng	You had better not start until they arrive.
17632	eng	You should pay attention to his story.
17633	eng	You must not smoke till you grow up.
17634	eng	What are you learning from the teacher?
17635	eng	You are young boys.
17636	eng	You belong to the next generation.
17637	eng	You may swim now.
17638	eng	You are to hand in your assignments by Monday.
17640	eng	You didn't need to hurry.
17641	eng	You must conform to the rules.
17642	eng	All of you did good work.
17643	eng	What do you learn at school?
17646	eng	You should try to be more polite.
17648	eng	All of you are diligent.
17649	eng	You must start at once.
17650	eng	It is imperative for you to act at once.
17651	eng	You must study hard and learn many things.
17652	eng	All you have to do is to learn this sentence by heart.
17654	eng	Are you students at this school?
17655	eng	You have to share the cake equally.
17656	eng	You should know what to read.
17658	eng	Compare your translation with the one on the blackboard.
17659	eng	Compare your sentence with the one on the blackboard.
17660	eng	Who is your teacher?
17661	eng	What was the cause of your quarrel?
17662	eng	I don't approve your decision.
17663	eng	I wonder which of you will win.
17664	eng	There are merits and demerits to both your opinions so I'm not going to decide right away which to support.
17665	eng	Your team is stronger than ours.
17666	eng	Any of you can do it.
17667	eng	Which of you came here first?
17669	eng	Did any of you gentlemen wait on this man?
17670	eng	I think I might join you, but I haven't decided yet.
17671	eng	You've got no alibi for the day of the murder.
17672	eng	Just as you treat me, so I will treat you.
17673	eng	If you're going to the beach, count me in.
17675	eng	When will you complete the preparations?
17676	eng	Boys, don't make any noise.
17677	eng	All you have to do is wait.
17678	eng	Not only you but I also was to blame.
17679	eng	Not only you but also he is ignorant of the truth.
17680	eng	He as well as you likes baseball.
17681	eng	Not only are you wrong, but I am wrong too.
17682	eng	We are both to blame.
17683	eng	You are not the only one responsible for it, I am too.
17685	eng	Only you answered the question.
17687	eng	Only you can carry the bag.
17688	eng	What a memory you have.
17689	eng	You're the only one who can do it.
17690	eng	I'm quite all right if you have no objection to it.
17692	eng	You are the man I've been looking for.
17693	eng	You're the best man for the job.
17694	eng	Don't you move from here.
17696	eng	I hadn't recognized the importance of this document until you told me about it.
17697	eng	I was disappointed at your absence.
17698	eng	Well may you ask why!
17699	eng	I had been to the hospital before you came.
17700	eng	I took it for granted that you would come.
17701	eng	I had no idea that you were coming.
17702	eng	It doesn't matter whether you come or not.
17703	eng	It does not matter to me whether you come or not.
17704	eng	It's a pity that you can't come.
17705	eng	As long as you are here, we might as well begin.
17706	eng	What is it that you want?
17707	eng	I want you.
17708	eng	Either you or your friend is wrong.
17709	eng	I'm amazed by the ease with which you solve the problem.
17710	eng	I will have left when you return.
17711	eng	He will have left here by the time you return.
17712	eng	I will have left here before you return.
17713	eng	I take it from your silence that you are not satisfied with my answer.
17714	eng	We thought we would write out the directions, in case you got lost.
17715	eng	I want to know if you'll be free tomorrow.
17716	eng	I am glad that you have returned safe.
17717	eng	What would you do if you were in my place?
17720	eng	I would like you to think about what you would have done in my place.
17721	eng	What would you do in my place?
17722	eng	That you don't believe me is a great pity.
17723	eng	The information you gave me is of little use.
17724	eng	You or I will be chosen.
17726	eng	Either you or I am wrong.
17727	eng	It is not necessary for you to take his advice if you don't want to.
17728	eng	If you're busy, I'll help you.
17729	eng	Didn't they teach you common sense as well as typing at the school where you studied?
17730	eng	I noticed you entering my room.
17732	eng	Never did I dream that you would lose.
17734	eng	I will lend you whatever book you need.
17735	eng	I need you.
17736	eng	You do not necessarily have to go there yourself.
17737	eng	You did well to keep the secret.
17738	eng	Whether you like her or not, you can't marry her.
17739	eng	I don't know whether you like her or not.
17740	eng	It is not good that you did not ask her name.
17741	eng	It is cruel of you to find fault with her.
17742	eng	What you said to her isn't accepted as a joke.
17743	eng	Either you or she has to go there.
17744	eng	As you have insulted him, he is cross with you.
17745	eng	We thought it wrong that you should punish him.
17746	eng	It is no use your waiting for him.
17747	eng	It is no use your trying to persuade him.
17748	eng	Does he know that you love him?
17749	eng	Imagine yourself to be in his place.
17750	eng	You did well not to follow his advice.
17751	eng	It was foolish of you to accept his offer.
17752	eng	You did wrong to refuse his help.
17753	eng	Either you or he is wrong.
17754	eng	Either you or he has to attend the meeting.
17755	eng	It was wise of you to ask him for help.
17756	eng	You are quite justified in answering him back.
17757	eng	Whatever you said to him made him feel better.
17758	eng	I can't approve of your going out with him.
17759	eng	I cannot approve of your going out with him.
17760	eng	I don't approve of your going out with him.
17761	eng	Either you are right or he is.
17764	eng	Show me what you bought.
17765	eng	How much is the car you are planning to buy?
17766	eng	I saw you with a tall boy.
17767	eng	He is no more foolish than you are.
17768	eng	It is amazing that you won the prize.
17769	eng	It is amazing; you should have won the prize.
17770	eng	It's a pity that you should leave Japan.
17772	eng	I'll take over your duties while you are away from Japan.
17773	eng	I am going to do it whether you agree or not.
17774	eng	I don't object to your going out to work, but who will look after the children?
17775	eng	I'm very happy you'll be visiting Tokyo next month.
17776	eng	You have good reason to be angry.
17777	eng	The success resulted from your efforts.
17778	eng	We were just talking about you when you called.
17780	eng	It is difficult for you to climb to the mountaintop.
17781	eng	It's quite plain that you haven't been paying attention.
17782	eng	Your advice led me to success.
17783	eng	It is a pity that you can't join us.
17784	eng	You had better not wake me up when you come in.
17785	eng	I sincerely hope that you will soon recover from your illness.
17786	eng	Unless you make a decision quickly, the opportunity will be lost.
17787	eng	I hope that you will get well soon.
17789	eng	I found the very thing you had been looking for.
17790	eng	It is plain that you have done this before.
17791	eng	I don't care whichever you choose.
17792	eng	It is not surprising that you should be scolded by your teacher.
17793	eng	You speak first; I will speak after.
17794	eng	Well do I remember the day you were born.
17795	eng	I guess you are right.
17796	eng	If you are honest, I will hire you.
17797	eng	Do what you think is right.
17798	eng	Your success depends on your efforts.
17799	eng	Whether you will succeed or not depends on your efforts.
17800	eng	I'm so glad that you succeeded.
17801	eng	I am glad that you have succeeded.
17802	eng	I'm glad to hear of your success.
17803	eng	Tell me when you will call me.
17805	eng	It's to your credit that you told the truth.
17806	eng	What happened to the girl you were sharing the bedroom with?
17807	eng	I should be glad if you got the job.
17808	eng	You may or may not win.
17809	eng	I will do it on the condition that you help me.
17810	eng	If it were not for your help, I might have failed.
17811	eng	Thanks to your help, I could understand the book quite well.
17812	eng	Your o's look like a's.
17813	eng	They will have arrived there before you start.
17814	eng	He came after you left.
17815	eng	You must do your homework at once.
17816	eng	Who took care of the dog while you were away?
17817	eng	I will wait till you have written the letter.
17818	eng	It is strange that you should fail.
17819	eng	You may fail, for all I care.
17820	eng	The reason why you failed is you did not try hard enough.
17821	eng	When you speak of a pay-raise before recognition, I am inclined to think you are putting the cart before the horse.
17822	eng	A time will come when you will regret your action.
17823	eng	You may as well go yourself.
17824	eng	You should talk to the teacher yourself.
17825	eng	You talk next and you be quiet.
17826	eng	We heard the news that you had passed the exam.
17827	eng	I think it's a pity you could not come to our party.
17828	eng	I don't like you any more than you like me.
17829	eng	I love you more than you love me.
17831	eng	Either you or I must go in his place.
17834	eng	What's the reason that made you call me?
17835	eng	What is it that you want me to do?
17836	eng	I can't thank you enough for what you did for me.
17837	eng	I hope you will join us in the parade and march along the street.
17838	eng	I wish you could come with us.
17839	eng	I'll look after your affairs when you are dead.
17840	eng	I don't have as much money as you think.
17841	eng	How much money did you spend in total?
17842	eng	Can you account for all the money you spent?
17844	eng	I will wait until you have finished your homework.
17845	eng	It makes no difference whether you agree or not.
17846	eng	With your approval, I would like to offer him the job.
17847	eng	It was wise of you to take your umbrella with you.
17848	eng	Show me the doll that you bought yesterday.
17849	eng	Nothing is so tasty as the dish you make.
17850	eng	I'll help you so long as you do your best.
17851	eng	Choose the color you like the best.
17852	eng	The paint on the seat on which you are sitting is still wet.
17853	eng	It makes little difference whether you go today or tomorrow.
17854	eng	It will not make much difference whether you go today or tomorrow.
17855	eng	Your mother has made you what you are.
17856	eng	What you've just told me chimes in with what I heard yesterday.
17857	eng	What you need the most now is courage.
17858	eng	This is all you have to do now.
17859	eng	It is necessary for you to go and encourage the girl.
17860	eng	It makes no difference whether you go or not.
17863	eng	You don't need to go unless you want to.
17864	eng	If you don't go, I won't, either.
17865	eng	You don't have to go unless you want to.
17867	eng	I don't care as long as you are happy.
17868	eng	Your meaning is beyond me.
17869	eng	What you have said applies only to single women.
17871	eng	What you said surprised me.
17872	eng	Whatever you may say, I won't give it up.
17874	eng	The picture you are looking at is a copy of a Picasso.
17875	eng	The picture you are looking at costs 100,000 yen.
17876	eng	What I can't make out is why you have changed your mind.
17877	eng	I'll make allowances for your lack of experience.
17878	eng	By the time you get out of jail, she'll probably have gotten married.
17879	eng	Either you or your brother is wrong.
17881	eng	I know you are rich.
17882	eng	You can't be hungry. You've just had dinner.
17884	eng	I hope you'll never turn Communist.
17885	eng	What a lonely world it will be with you away!
17886	eng	Be sure to put out the fire before you leave.
17887	eng	I will not allow you to be ill-treated.
17888	eng	He will be studying when you get up.
17889	eng	She'll have left before you come back.
17890	eng	I wish you could drop in at my house on your way home.
17891	eng	I'll stay here till you get back.
17892	eng	I will have finished the work before you return.
17893	eng	The money you give them will be put to good use.
17894	eng	Thanks to your stupidity, we lost the game.
17895	eng	It's clear that you're wrong.
17897	eng	I do not for a moment think you are wrong.
17898	eng	I can't help but think you're making a mistake.
17900	eng	If you are wrong, I am wrong too.
17901	eng	You shouldn't have paid the bill.
17902	eng	It is important for you to learn a foreign language.
17903	eng	I'll open the curtain for you to look out.
17904	eng	I'm counting on you to join us.
17905	eng	I am counting on you to join us.
17906	eng	It is a pity that you cannot travel with us.
17907	eng	Hearing you sing, people might take you for a girl.
17909	eng	I'll come again when you are free.
17910	eng	It's no use your saying anything.
17911	eng	Whatever you may say, you won't be believed.
17912	eng	Say what you will, he won't accept your invitation.
17913	eng	I haven't the faintest idea what you mean.
17914	eng	It matters little what you do.
17915	eng	I do not mind what you do.
17916	eng	Whatever you say, I'll marry her.
17917	eng	Say what you will, I will act on my own judgement.
17918	eng	No matter what you say, he still won't do it.
17919	eng	Whatever you may say, I don't believe you.
17921	eng	It's good to talk things over before you buy something.
17922	eng	I wish you were close to me.
17923	eng	It was bad of you to get angry at your wife.
17924	eng	Your refusal to help complicated matters.
17925	eng	I can no more speak French than you can speak English.
17926	eng	What is the main purpose of your studying English?
17927	eng	If you could only speak English, you would be perfect.
17928	eng	It's evident that you told a lie.
17929	eng	What is that thing in your right hand?
17930	eng	Would you mind making an extra cup of coffee whenever you decide to have some?
17931	eng	It seems as if you are the first one here.
17932	eng	It is risky for you to go into that area alone.
17934	eng	I enjoyed the holiday all the better for being with you.
17935	eng	As long as you stick to one style, you can't hit upon a wonderful idea.
17936	eng	You are to blame.
17937	eng	You are not to blame, nor is he.
17938	eng	It is plain that you are to blame.
17939	eng	You need not take the trouble to go there.
17940	eng	You're going to leave for London next Sunday, aren't you?
17941	eng	It is because you are lazy that you cannot write your report.
17942	eng	I will come on Monday unless you write to the contrary.
17943	eng	I was about to leave when you telephoned.
17944	eng	I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
17945	eng	You go first.
17946	eng	I heard it from you.
17947	eng	I stayed home last night to be able to receive your call.
17948	eng	I didn't expect such a nice present from you.
17949	eng	You can do whatever you want to.
17950	eng	It was silly of you to trust them.
17951	eng	I would do it in a different way than you did.
17952	eng	What you've done is profitable only to the enemy.
17953	eng	In terms of the pay you will get, is this a good job?
17955	eng	If you were to fall from that bridge, it would be almost impossible to rescue you.
17956	eng	If you ask him again, he may change his mind.
17959	eng	No harm will come to you.
17960	eng	I think it's wonderful that you're going on a picnic.
17961	eng	Is it true that you are going to Paris?
17962	eng	I am not any more foolish than you are.
17963	eng	The shoes you are wearing look rather expensive.
17964	eng	I will see to it that you meet her at the party.
17965	eng	Say what you will, I think he is an honest person.
17966	eng	I will help him no matter what you say.
17968	eng	Say what you will; I won't change my mind.
17969	eng	I marvel how you could agree to the proposal.
17970	eng	It is obvious why you have a stomach-ache.
17971	eng	I can imagine how you felt.
17972	eng	However fast you may walk, you can't catch up with him.
17973	eng	Try as you may, you will not be able to read as many as five novels in a day.
17974	eng	Try to estimate how much you spent on books.
17975	eng	I have a good mind to strike you for being so rude.
17976	eng	No matter where you may go, don't forget to write to me.
17977	eng	I must go there irrespective of what you think.
17978	eng	You should have nothing to complain about.
17979	eng	No wonder you could not open the door.
17981	eng	What is it that makes you think that way?
17982	eng	I'm surprised at your behavior.
17983	eng	It's strange you say that.
17984	eng	I will do my best to put such an idea out of your head.
17985	eng	How can I feel relaxed, with you watching me like that?
17986	eng	I can't abide hearing you cry so bitterly.
17987	eng	It is outrageous that you should spend so much money.
17988	eng	It is a pity that you should lose such a chance.
17989	eng	It is foolish of you to believe such a thing.
17990	eng	It's absurd of you to do that.
17991	eng	It is absurd of you to do that.
17992	eng	It is no use your trying to deny it.
17993	eng	It is a great pity that you don't know it.
17994	eng	It makes no difference to me whether you believe it or not.
17995	eng	It makes little difference to me whether you believe it or not.
17996	eng	It is right that you should write it.
17997	eng	The day will come when you will realize it.
17998	eng	The time will come when you'll regret it.
17999	eng	I'm glad you liked it.
18000	eng	You are mad to try to do it all alone.
18001	eng	I wish you had not told the story to my mother.
18002	eng	When was it that you visited the museum?
18003	eng	It is no wonder that you are turning down the proposal.
18004	eng	What made it difficult for you to carry out the plan?
18005	eng	It is absolutely necessary that you be at the meeting.
18006	eng	You have no good reason for thinking as you do.
18007	eng	I cannot believe you did not see him then.
18008	eng	Ten to one you can pass the test.
18009	eng	The time will come when you will be sorry for it.
18010	eng	I'll do it, if you insist.
18011	eng	I can't work with you standing there.
18012	eng	By the time you got there, the sun had set.
18013	eng	You gave me a real surprise when you showed up there.
18014	eng	Since you say so.
18015	eng	You may well say so, but I cannot agree.
18016	eng	There is no reason why you shouldn't do such a thing.
18017	eng	I don't blame you.
18018	eng	I can't allow you to do that.
18019	eng	There are a good many reasons why you shouldn't do it.
18020	eng	I don't blame you for doing that.
18021	eng	We will pay you according to the amount of work you do.
18022	eng	I'm glad you enjoy skiing, but I guess it's just not my cup of tea.
18023	eng	I'll do everything you tell me to do.
18024	eng	Your conduct is absolutely shameful.
18025	eng	I cannot see you behaving like that.
18026	eng	I didn't expect you to get here so soon.
18027	eng	It was too bad you couldn't come.
18028	eng	It's a pity that you couldn't come.
18029	eng	It is easy for you to solve this problem.
18030	eng	You wrote this book?
18031	eng	I didn't know that you were in this town.
18032	eng	It is dangerous for you to swim in this river.
18033	eng	It is out of the question for you to go to New York this weekend.
18034	eng	It is very difficult for you to do this work.
18035	eng	The time will come when you will understand this.
18036	eng	Where was it that you found this key?
18037	eng	I didn't expect you to turn up here.
18038	eng	There is no need for you to stay here.
18039	eng	As long as you're here, I'll stay.
18040	eng	With you here beside me I'm not afraid of anything. You're my fortress.
18042	eng	The watch you gave me doesn't keep time.
18043	eng	I had no notion that you were coming.
18047	eng	My life would be completely empty without you.
18048	eng	You'll be missed by your friends.
18050	eng	We shall all miss you when you go away.
18051	eng	I miss you badly.
18052	eng	How I miss you.
18053	eng	I miss you very much.
18054	eng	We all miss you very much.
18055	eng	We will miss you badly.
18056	eng	Whenever you come, I'm ready.
18057	eng	It is because you work too much that you are sleepy all the time.
18058	eng	Why is it that you are always late?
18059	eng	You may stay here as long as you like.
18060	eng	You can talk until you're blue in the face, but you'll never convince me.
18061	eng	Laugh as much as you like; I'll stick to my plan to the bitter end.
18062	eng	I cannot endure your going.
18063	eng	You walk too fast for me to keep up with you.
18064	eng	If only you had told me the whole story at that time!
18065	eng	It is impossible for you to jump two meters high.
18066	eng	We think it is very dangerous that you're climbing the mountain alone.
18067	eng	Here is a letter for you.
18068	eng	Are you saying that our plan was accepted? I hope you're not showing me any premature happiness here.
18069	eng	You, be quiet!
18070	eng	Have you ever seen Mt. Fuji? It is beautiful beyond description.
18071	eng	You've filled out.
18072	eng	What time will you leave?
18073	eng	You don't understand.

18082	eng	How long does a bear sleep?
18083	eng	The bear began tearing at the tent.
18084	eng	When bears sleep or lie down, their postures depend on whether they want to get rid of heat or conserve it.
18085	eng	No one noticed the bear's appearance.
18086	eng	Take off your socks, please.

18154	eng	I felt hungry.
18155	eng	With hunger and fatigue, the dog died at last.
18156	eng	Hunger is one of the greatest social miseries.
18157	eng	Hunger is the best sauce.
18159	eng	He cannot be hungry; he has just had lunch.
18160	eng	Hunger compelled the boy to steal money from the cash register.
18161	eng	Hunger drove him to steal.
18162	eng	It is a shameful fact that, while there are lands where people suffer from hunger, within Japan there are many households and restaurants where much food is thrown away.

20373	eng	Watch out! There's a big hole there.
20374	eng	Beware! There's a car coming!
20375	eng	Take care of yourself, and have a good time!
20376	eng	After an awkward pause, Bill took her by the hand and dragged her upstairs.
20377	eng	The weather is fickle.
20378	eng	He is a good fellow, to be sure, but he isn't reliable.
20379	eng	Are you crazy?
20380	eng	I wish I could think of something to say.
20381	eng	The pitiful sight moved us to tears.
20383	eng	Faint heart never won fair lady.
20384	eng	It's just your imagination.
20385	eng	Whether you like it or not, you have to go.
20386	eng	Like it?
20388	eng	I hope you'll like it.
20389	eng	You like it, huh?
20390	eng	Please think nothing of it.
20391	eng	Don't worry about it!
20392	eng	Never mind.
20393	eng	Never mind. Anyone can make mistakes.
20394	eng	Never mind!
20395	eng	Caring means being alive.
20396	eng	I just brush it off.
20397	eng	It's all right.
20398	eng	Forget it.
20400	eng	I appreciate your concern.
20401	eng	It's not easy to part with one's favorite possessions.
20402	eng	You've got a good head on your shoulders.
20403	eng	I found myself lying in my bedroom.
20404	eng	Please drink the beer before it goes flat.
20405	eng	I'm exhausted.
20406	eng	Turn off the television. I can't concentrate.
20408	eng	You should continue until you're satisfied.
20409	eng	I'm out of my mind.
20410	eng	I'm not in the mood.
20411	eng	Now that I notice it, I have nowhere to run.
20412	eng	It was there when I noticed it.
20413	eng	I found myself back in my room.
20414	eng	Thank goodness, you've come to.
20415	eng	It took him a moment to realize where he was after he came to.
20416	eng	He was so sad that he almost went mad.
20417	eng	I met nobody on my way home.
20418	eng	Could you show me your return ticket?
20419	eng	In the car on the way home, he was making plans for the next day.

20424	eng	I was caught in shower on my way home.
20425	eng	On arriving home, I discovered the burglary.
20426	eng	You can go home if you like.
20427	eng	I may have to come home late; if I do, I'll call you.
20428	eng	Returnees have trouble getting used to life in Japan.
20429	eng	I will inquire about the matter after I return home.
20430	eng	Why don't you look in on Mr Anderson on your way back?
20431	eng	Be sure to call home before you leave the office.
20432	eng	Please turn out the lights when you leave.
20433	eng	I'm very sorry I came home so late.
20434	eng	You are home late.
20435	eng	It is not my intention to return.
20436	eng	You're back late. What have you been up to?
20437	eng	Can you find your way home?
20438	eng	Don't fool around on your way home.
20439	eng	Don't play around too much after school.
20440	eng	I'm fixing the radio which I found on my way home.
20441	eng	I caught sight of a parade on my way home.
20442	eng	I was caught in a shower on my way home.
20443	eng	The trip back was very comfortable.
20444	eng	Do you have a return ticket to Japan?
20445	eng	Hopefully you can rest and relax on the flight home.
20446	eng	Would you mind picking up something on the way back?
20447	eng	Please drop in at my house on your way home.
20448	eng	Please drop in on your way home.
20449	eng	It'd be great if you could pick up some bread before you come home.
20450	eng	I don't wanna go back.
20451	eng	I'll call by the post office on the way home.
20452	eng	Wait here till I come back.
20453	eng	I will see him after I get back.
20454	eng	He asked me to wait there until he came back.
20455	eng	She scolded the child for coming home so late.
20456	eng	So nice that you are back.
20457	eng	On his return he found her daughter asleep.
20458	eng	My bicycle was gone when I returned.
20459	eng	Get back, get back!
20460	eng	How many pieces of carry-on are you going to take?
20461	eng	Are there movies on the plane?
20462	eng	Dinner will be served on board the plane.
20463	eng	His seat in the plane was on the aisle.
20464	eng	The riot police arrived on the scene.
20465	eng	Wit gives zest to conversation.
20466	eng	The captain will go to the meteorological office to get a weather briefing.
20468	eng	Passengers became nervous when the plane began to vibrate.
20469	eng	He is cranky.
20470	eng	The locomotive was pulling a long line of freight cars.
20471	eng	Mechanical power took the place of manual labor.
20472	eng	The downtime is caused by a mechanical problem.
20473	eng	The agonies of the machine age do not originate from the machines as such.
20474	eng	It is impossible to substitute machines for people themselves.
20475	eng	Press this button to start the machine.
20476	eng	I got the machine running.
20477	eng	The machine squealed for lack of oil.
20478	eng	Machinery uses a lot of electricity.
20480	eng	Machinery dispenses with much labor.
20481	eng	Machinery robs work of creative interest.
20482	eng	The machine was clogged with grease.
20483	eng	The machines are idle now.
20484	eng	You must feed the machine.
20485	eng	I can do it if you give me a chance.
20486	eng	I seize the moment and turn it to my advantage.
20487	eng	Don't throw away your chance.
20488	eng	You must take advantage of the opportunity.
20489	eng	One should always make the most of one's opportunities.
20490	eng	Thanks to the opportunity, we were able to avoid substantial effort.
20491	eng	I'll speak to him at the first opportunity.
20492	eng	A family should not spend all of its money to keep someone alive on a machine.
20493	eng	Chance is a nickname for Providence.
20494	eng	You should see this film if you get the opportunity.
20495	eng	You should change your job if the occasion arises.
20496	eng	I will see him at the first opportunity.
20497	eng	I will do it at the first opportunity.
20498	eng	It's a pity we didn't visit Tom when we had the chance.
20499	eng	The plane rose sharply before leveling off as it left the coast.
20500	eng	When the time is ripe, be bold and go for it! I'll stand by you.
20501	eng	There were two abstentions.
20502	eng	I was busy with work for the term exam.
20503	eng	The results of the term examination were anything but satisfactory.
20504	eng	I have to give myself up to studying for final exams.
20505	eng	I've really got to buckle down and study for our final exams.
20506	eng	I'm busy because the finals are drawing on.
20507	eng	Submit your term papers to Professor White.
20508	eng	How is your term paper coming along?
20509	eng	He passed the test as was expected.
20510	eng	As had been expected, the weather turned out to be very fine.
20511	eng	We were filled with joyful expectation.
20512	eng	Prospect is often better than possession.
20513	eng	As was expected, he succeeded in winning the prize.
20516	eng	I'm sure you'll whip us up something really good.
20517	eng	The restaurant was a bummer.
20518	eng	As was expected, he won the prize.
20519	eng	You must get the job done before the deadline.
20520	eng	Let's get an open ticket.
20521	eng	How long do you want it for?
20522	eng	The known must be separated from the unknown.
20523	eng	She knew what it was like for married women to look after houses, husbands and children.
20524	eng	Let bygones be bygones.
20525	eng	We tend to welcome only proofs of what we already know.
20526	eng	Now, the situation is out of hand.
20527	eng	I have already done my homework.
20528	eng	As you already know.
20529	eng	The odds are against me, so I think I'll quit now.
20530	eng	The flag is up.
20531	eng	Keep sight of the flag.
20532	eng	When I tried to move the desk, one of its legs made a jarring sound as it scraped across the floor.

20600	eng	I'll give you as many as you like.
20601	eng	Geometry, about which I know nothing, seems like a very dull subject.
20602	eng	Several newspapers published the story.
20604	eng	You must not give up hope.
20605	eng	Having realized his hope, he returned home.
20606	eng	Don't give up hope.
20607	eng	Thoughts of hope, dreams I'll never find.
20608	eng	Hope is the last thing that man has to flee unto.
20609	eng	I didn't give up for lack of hope.
20610	eng	As long as you have hope, a chance remains.
20611	eng	The importation of rare wild animals to this country is strictly prohibited.
20612	eng	No one can turn the clock back.
20613	eng	When you take shelter, make sure you go under a big tree.
20614	eng	I was too glad not to jump up.
20615	eng	What with joy and shame, she blushed to the ears.
20616	eng	To my joy, my daughter passed the examination.
20617	eng	To her joy, she passed the entrance examination.
20618	eng	I know you're happy about it. Why don't you just show it?
20619	eng	Strange to say, the figure went out of sight suddenly.
20620	eng	It may sound strange, but what she said is true.
20621	eng	Strange as it may sound, this is true.
20622	eng	It may sound strange, but what he said is true.

20680	eng	Joy was mingled with sorrow.
20681	eng	Short pleasure, long repentance.
20682	eng	Tears of joy rained down their cheeks.
20683	eng	Delight is the opposite of sorrow.
20684	eng	Waves of joy drift through my opened heart.
20685	eng	It is easier to sympathize with sorrow than to sympathize with joy.
20686	eng	Her face was animated by joy.
20687	eng	I jumped for joy.
20688	eng	His joy showed on his face.
20691	eng	Sensing danger, he ran away.
20692	eng	He stayed behind in view of possible danger.
20693	eng	Let's take a chance and go for broke.
20694	eng	Danger comes soonest when it is despised.
20695	eng	He was brave in the face of danger.
20696	eng	He was still as still in the presence of danger.
20697	eng	When they are in danger, they run away.

20699	eng	The red lamp lights up in case of danger.
20700	eng	There's a scent of danger.
20701	eng	Dangerous driving should be punished.
20702	eng	Is there any danger?
20703	eng	He remains calm in the face of danger.
20704	eng	No idea of danger crossed my mind then.
20705	eng	The more danger, the more honor.
20706	eng	This doesn't mean the danger has passed.
20707	eng	The danger past and God forgotten.
20708	eng	Dangers give relish to an adventure.
20709	eng	Danger. Keep out!
20710	eng	In a crisis you must keep your head.
20711	eng	It is essential to keep calm in a time of crisis and avoid going haywire.
20712	eng	I almost missed the train.
20713	eng	I was nearly run over by a car.
20714	eng	If it gets dangerous, give me a call.

20722	eng	She wasn't hurt, but she got goose bumps when her car nearly crashed.
20723	eng	I barely missed being struck.
20724	eng	I had a narrow escape.
20725	eng	It was a close call when the little girl almost drowned in the lake.
20726	eng	Corporate bankruptcies continued at a high level last month.

20747	eng	He looks pale.
20749	eng	You look pale. What's the matter with you?
20750	eng	You look pale. You'd better take a day off.
20751	eng	Billy often hits his face against windows.
20753	eng	You look green.
20754	eng	Wash your face.
20755	eng	He told me to wash my face.
20756	eng	Wipe your face clean.
20757	eng	To lose face means to be humiliated.
20758	eng	A shave, please.
20759	eng	Turn your face this way.
20760	eng	Looks aside, she is very good-natured.
20762	eng	Slapped on the face, I didn't fight back.
20763	eng	Wash up.
20764	eng	I'm getting little pimples on my face. I wonder if I've been getting enough sleep lately.

20776	eng	I try.
20777	eng	I thought our boss was stubborn as a mule but actually he has his cute side.
20778	eng	The more stubborn you are, the more isolated you become.
20779	eng	If it becomes stubborn indeed it stands alone.
20780	eng	You should be friendly rather than stubborn.
20781	eng	I've got my stubbornness from my father.
20782	eng	Look out for rock slides.
20783	eng	The fall from the ledge shattered his leg.

20789	eng	A rock stuck out from the bank into the river.
20790	eng	I don't exist to you.
20791	eng	You have to adjust your glasses to your eyes.

24798	eng	First of all, he is very worried about his daughter's health.
24799	eng	Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?
24800	eng	Not having heard from him, I wrote to him again.
24801	eng	That won't change anything.
24803	eng	You have nothing to fear.
24804	eng	You have no need to be ashamed.
24805	eng	It is no use your pretending that you know nothing.

24807	eng	There is nothing to worry about.
24808	eng	Nothing can force me to give it up.
24809	eng	There is no hurry.
24810	eng	I could not see anything.
24811	eng	I have no real intent.
24812	eng	Nothing's gonna change my world.
24813	eng	Those who possess nothing lose nothing.
24814	eng	Above all, I want to be healthy.
24815	eng	Nothing is to be compared to its beauty.
24816	eng	I don't feel like anything.
24817	eng	Having nothing to do, he went downtown.
24818	eng	Having nothing to do, I watched television.
24819	eng	There's nothing to do, so I may as well go to bed.
24820	eng	Work is preferable to idleness.
24821	eng	Don't cry before you're hurt.
24822	eng	You can wear my scarf as long as you don't spill anything on it.
24823	eng	Everything points to his guilt.
24824	eng	Those who forget everything are happy.
24825	eng	You had better tell me the whole story.
24826	eng	He looked as if he knew all about it.
24827	eng	Sometimes everything goes wrong.
24828	eng	Everything seemed to go wrong with me.
24829	eng	Everything is now ready for you.
24830	eng	You didn't leave me shit.
24831	eng	Everything went better than I had expected.
24833	eng	No one shall be held in slavery.
24834	eng	Before everything you should take better care of your health.
24835	eng	What were we talking about?
24838	eng	What does this stand for?
24840	eng	It is good for nothing.
24842	eng	For what purpose did he come here?
24843	eng	Few people are free of care.
24844	eng	What do I have?
24846	eng	What thought do you think had the biggest impact on the English in the Middle Ages?

24854	eng	Why did her father go to Japan?
24855	eng	What on earth do you want six copies of the same book for?
24856	eng	What are you working for?
24857	eng	What did you buy this expensive dictionary for?
24858	eng	What do you learn English for?
24859	eng	What did you buy it for?
24862	eng	For what?
24863	eng	What kind of sandwich do you want?
24867	eng	What for?
24868	eng	The allusion was not lost on me.
24869	eng	What will you have to eat?
24870	eng	Just tell me what you'd like me to do.
24871	eng	I will be glad if I can serve you in any way.
24872	eng	In fact, I'll even call George at the office and tell him he ought to come home and help out.

24895	eng	I can't say for sure.
24896	eng	What an incredible amount of work he has done!
24897	eng	I can't say.
24898	eng	I have no words to express my gratitude.
