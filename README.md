# ITSP_Noise_Reduction_Project_2ndSem
The DataFilesGeneration.ipynb program here can generate a database of noisy speech clips by randomly mixing noise clips (freely available on the internet, cited within the code itself) with actual human sentences generated from Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools by Google (gTTs) (https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#examples)
to create a corpus of noisy speech clips to be used for meeting the data requirements of a noise filtration project involving machine learning.
